# CORNIFER

## Pre-requisite
* Make sure you are runnning python 3.8 or above.
* Install pip3.
* Install matplotlib, pandas, numpy, scipy or run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`. If you are manually installing these packages, you can find the required versions in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt),


## Repository Content
* [metro-pop-slo](metro-pop-lat/): This comprises the latencies for each metro-pop pair at a given percentile. We use the 90th percentile window in our implementation.
* [topologies](topologies/): This comprises all the synthetic topologies generated by CORNIFER. All the files are in the format of `topology_{size}_{number}`, where `size` represents the number of metro locations in the topology. We have 10 variations of each topology size, and `number` represents any number between 1 and 10.
* [results](results/): Once you run CORNIFER, the results will be placed here. It currently has an example output for your reference.

**Note that all the latency measurements are synthetic.**


## Running Cornifer
* Clone the repository.
* Run `python cornifer.py -s <topology_size> -n <topology_number>` to find the virtual WAN placement of topology of size `topology_size` and variation `topology_number`. Eg: Running `python cornifer.py -s 5 -n 1` with find placement for [topology_5_1.csv](Topologies/topology_5_1.csv). This finds placement for `l_optimal`, `k_optimal`, `mean_k` mode, and writes the output under [results/{mode}/topology_{size}_{number}](results/).
